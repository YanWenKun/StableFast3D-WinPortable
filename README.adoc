A dedicated package for running
https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-fast-3d[Stable Fast 3D]
official ComfyUI workflow on Windows.

## How to use

1. You need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB VRAM.

2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022
(
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools[Page]
|
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe[EXE]
).
During the setup, select "Desktop development with C++" workload.
You only need these two optional components:

** MSVC Build Tools (compilers and libraries)
** CMake for C++ on Windows
** Some PyTorch extension code needs to be compiled during runtime, so the build tools are needed. If you already installed Visual Studio with C++ workload, just skip this step.

3. Install
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-1-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network[CUDA Toolkit],
with version no later than 12.4.1.
You only need to install
